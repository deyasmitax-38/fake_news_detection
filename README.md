# üì∞ Fake News Detection and Evaluation with Confusion Matrix

## üìå Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of distinguishing **fake news** from **true news** using **machine learning techniques**. The classification model is trained on textual data, and its performance is evaluated using a **confusion matrix** and standard metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing (cleaning text, removing special characters, tokenization)
- Word2Vec embedding for converting text to numerical vectors
- Classification using Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and metrics

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **Fake news** articles (from unreliable sources verified by Politifact and Wikipedia)
- **True news** articles (from Reuters.com)

Since the dataset files are large, they are available via **Google Drive**:

- [Fake News Dataset (CSV)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZMLQRpBetT8BVq3gL9sQFzuRtqXbGWDA/view?usp=sharing)
- [True News Dataset (CSV)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1chFUjS_tcp79qB_Sea5GsB47bF6aMSjk/view?usp=sharing)
